Description: Home Field Advantage (HFA) is the fitness gain an entry (genotype) 
  realizes by growing in its home location, which is empirically defined as the 
  location of highest fitness relative to other entries (Ewing et al., 2019). 
  Through identifying sites with high HFA and yield heritability, we discuss 
  potential strategies for selection efforts to further incorporate local 
  adaptation.
